Yo Yo Yo! Chika Fujiwara is playing a game called "Flipping Words". Players are given a sentence, and are tasked to reverse every word in that sentence. 

Chika, well... being Chika, she wants to cheat. She needs your help to make a program that given a sentence, outputs the reverse of every word.

### Input Format
The first line contains a string $s$. Words in a sentence are seperated by <strong>one</strong> space. Words are defined as a group of characters not containing any space.
<br />

### Constraints

$1 \leq s.length \leq 500$  

### Output Format

A string after reversing all the words.

<hr />

#### Sample Input
The first line is a string $s$

```
hello world.
```

#### Sample Output

```
olleh .dlrow
```

#### Sample Output Explanation
`hello` is reversed, producing `olleh`<br />
Next, `world.` is reversed, producing `.dlrow`<br />

They are then joined together, resulting in our final output.
